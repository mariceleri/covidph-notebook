      <p class="description">This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map">choropleth map</a> that
        shows the relative COVID-19 cases between the municipalities and cities of the Philippines. The cases are
        normalized with the population of each local government boundary. This is to help the viewer compare cases with
        connection to population densities. <br><br>This map aims to help the viewer find patterns and gain
        insights on the spread of the disease and the effects of the community and goverment efforts. This only
        provides a "big
        picture" and should not be used as basis for any decision.
        <br><br>All the data is free and comes from the public domain. It is entered manually and this map may not be
        always up
        to
        date.</p>
